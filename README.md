Data-driven exploration of Earth-like conditions among confirmed exoplanets
# Exohabitability Analytics

This project explores Earth-like conditions among confirmed exoplanets using
planetary radius and stellar temperature data. The analysis focuses on identifying
patterns that align with Earth-like environments through data visualization and
storytelling.

## Objective
To analyze how planetary size and stellar temperature relate to potential
habitability using visual analytics techniques.

## Key Questions
- How are confirmed exoplanets distributed by planetary radius?
- How does stellar temperature relate to planet size and habitability score?
- Where do Earth-sized planets cluster within stellar environments?

## Tools & Skills
- Tableau Public
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Data Storytelling

## Key Insights
- Most potentially habitable exoplanets cluster around Earth-sized radii
- Higher habitability scores appear within moderate stellar temperatures
- Habitability score reflects alignment with Earth-like conditions, not confirmed life
